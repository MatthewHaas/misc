## tic_tac_toe.py
Original code from CodeFoxx (https://github.com/iamcodefoxx/Tic-Tac-Toe) (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvi0rWTSkJkrunfhXH0tYuA).
I modified the code so that users cannot click on a square that has already been clicked on. The script does not currently contain any code specifying background color because it wasn't working for me (just defaulting to grey) so I removed it.
